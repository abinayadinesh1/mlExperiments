### Experimenting w/ ML

This is an end to end ml practice project on the iris flowers dataset. I tested 6 different ml models on our data and evaluated which one had the best accuracy score. I also created visualizations using matplotlib to demonstrate these in various graphs, like a box plot, multidimensional graph, histogram, etc. After finding out which model was best, I fit the data to that model and then applied it to a validation set. Lastly, we scored and evaluated the algorithm using the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. 

This was used to built intuition on data, visualizations, and when to use the right models. 

Iterations of this have been forked for high school AI curriculum.
