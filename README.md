An end to end ml practice project using the iris flowers dataset. In this project, we tested 6 different ml models on our data and evaluated which one had the ebst accuracy score. We also created visualizations using matplotlib to demonstrate these in various graphs, like a box plot, multidimensional graph, histogram, etc. After finding out which model was best, we fit the data to that model and then applied it to a validation set. Lastly, we scored and evaluated the algorithm using the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
